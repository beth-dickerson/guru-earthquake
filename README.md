Hello! Earthquake Data will show you some interesting info about top earthquake activity around the world. Scroll through the data. Be amazed.

1. Clone the git repo here: (https://github.com/beth-dickerson/guru-earthquake)
2. Set up the environment: npm install
3. Start the server: npm start

Happy quaking!

This project was created based on the React framework, and boosted with a few libraries.
- Material UI (http://www.material-ui.com/)
- Moment.js (https://momentjs.com/)
- A handy search tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRiMo2EjVds)
- And other helpful search tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlVkYnVXPl0)
- It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

* MaterialUI made everything look pretty.
* MomentJS allowed me to format the time.
* This assignment took me longer than the suggested 4-6 hours, but I enjoyed the entire process. Being given a problem to solve, rather than creating one on my own helps me to direct my continued learning with practical application and understand how to approach problems I have not thought of myself.
* I filtered the displayed data by magnitude, but could not figure out how to secondarily filter it by time. I left the (not working) code to demonstrate my last attempt, as it did not break it!
* I made a search area that has an onChange event handler, yet I was unsuccessful in connecting it to my API. I made further progress in it than I have before, so I see my steady improvement.
* I worked through this assignment on my own, instead of reaching out to friends and colleagues who are well-versed in JavaScript and React, because I wanted the opportunity to take this as far as I could on my own. (I will be reaching it this next week because I want to how to do these things, and now!)
